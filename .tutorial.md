## Getting started

Depending on the platform setup, the asset may initialize automatically or may need to be manually executed. To manually execute the asset, run the command `./gcp-asm-traffic.sh` on the terminal.

When you run the script, it sets up the pre-requisite automation tools behind the scenes. 

Please be patient, and allow a few seconds for the lab to initialize. 

You will be promted to enter any key to continue once the initialization process is complete.

There are 3 modes of operation. 

Change the mode by selecting step `m`, and enter your preference by selecting an option from the list below:

- `y` to preview configuration or commands.
- `n` to execute commands in the create mode.
- `d` to delete resources in the delete mode.

Enter any key to return to the menu, and click the **START** button below.

## Selecting a project

You need to select a project to deploy the resources required for this lab.

*Hint: You should be the Owner or Editor of this project. We recommend deleting the project at the end of the lab to avoid incurring additional costs.*

Change the mode by selecting step `m`, and select the create mode by entering `n` at the prompt.

If prompted for a code, enter a valid code. For help, contact `support@techequity.cloud`.

Click the **NEXT** button to continue.

## Sign in

You need to authenticate to `gcloud` to complete the lab.

When prompted to authenticate, enter `y`, click the link displayed, sign-in using your Google Cloud account, and click the `Allow` button to grant permissions to Google Cloud SDK. 

Click the `Copy` button to copy the authorization code. 

Return to the cloud shell terminal and paste the authorization code into the prompt to authenticate to cloud shell.

When prompted to change the project from `NOT_SET`, enter `y` and enter your project ID. 

Enter any key at the `$` prompt to return to the menu, and click the **NEXT** button to continue.
